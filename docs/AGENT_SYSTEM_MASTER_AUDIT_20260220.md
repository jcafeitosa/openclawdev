## 📈 PART 7: PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS

### Response Time by Agent Tier

```
Tier              Median    P95       P99
C-Level (Opus)    30-45s    60s       90s
Directors         15-25s    40s       60s
Architects        15-25s    40s       60s

```

### Concurrency Limits

```
Can Run Simultaneously: 100 agents
Memory per Agent:       ~50 MB (average)
Total Memory Budget:    5-8 GB
Network Connections:    Unlimited (via gateway)
Database Connections:   100 (postgres pool)
Token Budget/Hour:      50,000 (with fallbacks)
```

## 🔒 PART 8: SECURITY & ISOLATION

### Agent Isolation

| Level                | Implementation       | Current Status           |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Process Isolation    | Separate sessions    | ✅ Implemented           |
| Filesystem Isolation | Path whitelisting    | ⚠️ Basic (needs Phase 2) |
| Network Isolation    | API key per agent    | ⚠️ Shared credentials    |
| Memory Isolation     | Session memory only  | ✅ Implemented           |
| Credential Isolation | Vault access control | 🔴 No RBAC (Phase 2)     |

### Privilege Escalation Risks

**CRITICAL (Phase 1 Fix Required)**:

- 4 agents with elevated exec access (should be 1-2)
- Shared API credentials across agents
- No audit logging of privilege usage

**HIGH (Phase 2 Fix)**:

- Agents can read other agents' memory (if compromised)
- No token expiration per agent
- No rate limiting per agent

---

## 📊 PART 9: UTILIZATION & COST

### Cost by Agent Tier (Monthly)

```
C-Level (4 × Opus):         ~$8,000  (high decisions, low volume)
Directors (6 × Sonnet):     ~$3,000  (coordination, coordination)
Architects (4 × Sonnet):    ~$2,000  (design review, mentoring)
Engineers (15 × Sonnet):    ~$6,000  (implementation, high volume)
Specialists (35 × Haiku):   ~$2,500  (execution, optimization)
Governance (5 × Haiku):     ~$500    (24/7 minimal load)
Free Models (Fallback):     $0       (unlimited)

TOTAL MONTHLY:              ~$22,000 (pre-optimization)
AFTER OPTIMIZATION:         ~$6,000  (78% reduction via Phase 1-2)
```

### Utilization by Use Case

```
Strategic Decisions:  10% of time (high impact)
Engineering Work:     45% of time (code implementation)
Coordination/Planning: 20% of time (meetings, sprints)
Analysis/Research:    15% of time (investigations)
Idle/Standby:         10% of time (waiting for tasks)
```

## 💡 PART 11: CROSS-AGENT DEPENDENCIES

### Critical Communication Paths

```
C-Level ←→ Directors     (Daily decision voting)
Directors ←→ Engineers   (Sprint planning, task assignment)
Engineers ←→ Architects  (Design review, pattern discussion)
Architects ←→ C-Level    (Technology decisions, RFCs)
Governance ←→ All       (Monitoring, alerts, health checks)
```

### Information Flow

```
Inbound:  User Request → Gateway → Channel → Session
          ↓
          Agent Selection (by domain)

## 📋 PART 12: TRAINING & ONBOARDING

### New Agent Integration

**Setup Time**: ~2-4 hours per agent

1. **Identity** (30 min)
   - Assign name, ID, role
   - Model tier selection
   - Expertise areas

2. **Permissions** (30 min)
   - Tool access level
   - Budget allocation
   - Rate limits

3. **Team Context** (1 hour)
   - Reporting structure
   - Peer agents (collaborators)
   - Communication channels

4. **Knowledge Base** (1-2 hours)
   - SOUL.md, AGENTS.md
   - Domain documentation
   - Code patterns

## 🎯 PART 13: RECOMMENDED IMPROVEMENTS (Phase 2)

### Security Hardening

- [ ] Implement agent RBAC (who can talk to whom?)
- [ ] Audit logging of all agent actions
- [ ] Credential rotation per agent
- [ ] Filesystem isolation (sandbox paths)
- [ ] Memory isolation improvements

### Performance Optimization

- [ ] Agent-specific model caching
- [ ] Query optimization (reduce token usage)
- [ ] Parallel execution improvements
- [ ] Database connection pooling per agent

### Operational Excellence

- [ ] Automated agent health checks
- [ ] Self-healing for failed agents
- [ ] Cost attribution (per agent, per team)
- [ ] Usage analytics dashboard
- [ ] Automatic agent scaling

### Architectural Improvements

- [ ] Agent discovery service (auto-register)
- [ ] Capability marketplace (agents find each other)
- [ ] Hierarchical delegation automation
- [ ] Cross-team knowledge sharing
