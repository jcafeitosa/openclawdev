## 🎯 UI/INFRASTRUCTURE TEAMS STATUS

⚠️ **NOTE**: UI/Infra teams (Form MCP, Vercel, DigitalOcean, Docs, QA) were spawned earlier but session keys not found. Need to re-spawn for continuity.

**Planned For Next Phase**:

```
Team 1: Frontend Architect → Form MCP Pipeline
  - React Hook Form + Zod (60 min)
  - Then Dialog → Dropdown → Tabs cascade
  - Critical path

Team 2: DevOps Engineer → Vercel Setup
  - Account + landing page + preview env (35 min)
  - Parallel with other teams

Team 3: Database Engineer → DigitalOcean
  - Droplet + PostgreSQL + Spaces (75 min)
