## Collaboration Review Workflow

Use `collaboration` for structured async code reviews with tracked status.

### Submit Work for Review

```typescript
collaboration({
  action: "submit_review",
  artifact: "src/orders/order-service.ts",
  reviewers: ["security-engineer", "quality-engineer"],
  context: "New order creation flow. Focus on input validation and authorization.",
});
// Returns: { reviewId: "rev-abc123" }
```

### Submit Review Feedback

```typescript
// Approve with feedback
collaboration({
  action: "review.submit",
  reviewId: "rev-abc123",
  approved: true,
  feedback: "Input validation looks solid. Minor: consider adding rate limiting on create.",
});

// Reject with feedback
collaboration({
  action: "review.submit",
  reviewId: "rev-abc123",
  approved: false,
  feedback: "Missing authorization check on the delete endpoint. Must fix before merge.",
});
```

### Check Review Status

```typescript
// Get specific review
collaboration({ action: "review.get", reviewId: "rev-abc123" });

// List all pending reviews
collaboration({ action: "review.list" });

// List completed reviews
collaboration({ action: "review.list", completed: true });
```

### When to Use Collaboration Reviews

| Scenario            | Approach                                                               |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Quick spot check    | Direct review (read code, provide feedback)                            |
| Formal code review  | collaboration submit_review with tracked status                        |
| Security audit      | collaboration submit_review with security-engineer reviewer            |
| Architecture review | collaboration session.init for debate, then submit_review for sign-off |

## Confidence Scoring System

Every issue must have a confidence score (0-100). **Only report issues with score ≥ 80.**

| Score  | Level          | Meaning                                       |
| ------ | -------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 0-25   | False positive | Pre-existing issue or unrelated               |
| 26-50  | Possible       | Might be an issue, likely nitpick             |
| 51-75  | Probable       | Real issue but low impact                     |
| 76-90  | Important      | Likely real, will impact functionality        |
| 91-100 | Critical       | Confirmed bug or explicit guideline violation |

**Focus on quality over quantity.** 3 high-confidence issues beat 15 uncertain ones.

## PR Review Toolkit — Specialized Agents

For comprehensive PR reviews, use 6 specialized agents in parallel. Each focuses on one dimension.

### Running Full PR Review

```typescript
// Spawn all 6 agents in parallel
const pr = await exec("gh pr diff --name-only");
const files = pr.stdout.trim();

// Run in parallel
sessions_spawn({
  agentId: "review",
  task: `comment-analyzer: Review code comments accuracy in: ${files}`,
});
sessions_spawn({ agentId: "review", task: `pr-test-analyzer: Review test coverage in: ${files}` });
sessions_spawn({
  agentId: "review",
  task: `silent-failure-hunter: Find silent failures in: ${files}`,
});
sessions_spawn({
  agentId: "review",
  task: `type-design-analyzer: Analyze type design in: ${files}`,
});
sessions_spawn({
  agentId: "review",
  task: `code-reviewer: General review with confidence ≥80 in: ${files}`,
});
sessions_spawn({
  agentId: "review",
  task: `code-simplifier: Simplify code for clarity in: ${files}`,
});
```

### Agent 1: comment-analyzer

**When**: After adding docs/comments, before finalizing PR

**Mission**: Verify every comment adds genuine value and remains accurate.

Check:

- ✅ Function signatures match documented params/return types
- ✅ Described behavior aligns with actual code logic
- ✅ Referenced types, functions, variables exist and are used correctly
- ✅ Edge cases mentioned are actually handled
- ✅ Comments explain _why_, not _what_ (code already shows _what_)
- ❌ Comments that merely restate obvious code → flag for removal
- ❌ TODOs/FIXMEs that may already be addressed

### Agent 2: pr-test-analyzer

**When**: After creating or updating a PR with new functionality

**Mission**: Ensure tests cover critical paths without being pedantic about 100%.

Check:

- ✅ Error handling paths that could cause silent failures
- ✅ Edge cases for boundary conditions
- ✅ Critical business logic branches
- ✅ Negative test cases for validation logic
- ✅ Async/concurrent behavior where relevant
- Rate each gap: criticality 1-10 (10 = blocking)
- Explain specific regression each missing test would catch

### Agent 3: silent-failure-hunter

**When**: Reviewing any error handling, catch blocks, or fallback logic

**Non-negotiable rules**:

1. Silent failures are unacceptable — every error needs logging + user feedback
2. Users deserve actionable feedback — messages must say what failed and what to do
3. Fallbacks must be explicit and justified
4. Catch blocks must be specific — `catch (e: any)` hides unrelated errors
5. Mock/fake implementations belong only in tests

Systematically find:

- All try-catch blocks
- All error callbacks
- All conditional branches handling error states
- All fallback logic / default values on failure
- All optional chaining (`?.`) that might hide errors

### Agent 4: type-design-analyzer

**When**: Introducing new types, before PR creation, when refactoring types

**Rate each type on 4 dimensions (1-10)**:

1. **Encapsulation** — Are internals hidden? Can invariants be violated from outside?
2. **Invariant Expression** — How clearly are constraints communicated through the type structure?
3. **Invariant Usefulness** — Do invariants prevent real bugs? Are they aligned with business rules?
4. **Enforcement** — Are invariants enforced at compile-time where possible?

Report types with any dimension < 7.

### Agent 5: code-reviewer (with Confidence Scoring)

**When**: Proactively after writing code, before commits or PRs

Default scope: `git diff` (unstaged changes)

Review dimensions:

- **Project Guidelines**: CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md compliance, import patterns, naming
- **Bug Detection**: Logic errors, null handling, race conditions, memory leaks
- **Security**: All OWASP categories, auth checks, input validation
- **Code Quality**: Duplication, missing error handling, accessibility

**Format output**:

```
## Code Review

Reviewing: [files/scope]

### Critical Issues (confidence ≥ 91)
- [confidence: 95] file.ts:42 — [description] | [fix]

### Important Issues (confidence 80-90)
- [confidence: 85] file.ts:88 — [description] | [fix]

### No issues found / All checks pass ✅
```

### Agent 6: code-simplifier

**When**: After completing a logical chunk of code, before commit

**Focus**: Reduce complexity while preserving exact functionality.

Analyze:

- Redundant conditionals that can be simplified
- Nested logic that can be flattened
- Variables that exist only once (inline them)
- Code that can use built-in language features
- Overly verbose patterns vs concise equivalents

**Never**: Change behavior, add functionality, remove error handling, or change test coverage.

  model: "anthropic/claude-opus-4-5",
  label: "Security Review",
});
```

For quality review:

```typescript
sessions_spawn({
