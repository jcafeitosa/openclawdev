5 CORE PATTERNS IDENTIFIED AND DOCUMENTED
================================================================================

Pattern 1: Parallel Agent Execution with Confidence Scoring
- Key Plugins: code-review, feature-dev, pr-review-toolkit
- Architecture: 4-6 agents with independent 0-100 scoring
- Threshold: 80+ confidence for reporting
- Impact: 70-80% false positive reduction
- Status: FULLY DOCUMENTED

Pattern 2: Phased Workflows with Sequential Gates
- Key Plugins: feature-dev (7 phases), code-review (9 steps)
- Structure: Parallel exploration → Sequential decisions
- User Gates: Clarifying questions, approval before implementation
- Impact: <20% second iteration rate
- Status: FULLY DOCUMENTED

Pattern 3: Self-Referential Iteration Loops
- Key Plugin: ralph-wiggum
- Mechanism: Stop hook intercepts exit and re-injects prompt
- Safety: --max-iterations limit + --completion-promise
- Impact: $50k contracts for $297 API cost
- Status: FULLY DOCUMENTED

Pattern 4: Multi-Perspective Specialization
- Key Plugins: pr-review-toolkit (6 agents), code-review (4 agents)
- Design: One agent per focus area
- Coordination: Parallel or sequential based on dependencies
- Impact: 5-10x better precision per agent focus
- Status: FULLY DOCUMENTED

Pattern 5: Hook-Based Extensibility
- Key Plugins: ralph-wiggum, security-guidance, learning-output-style
- Events: PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop, SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit
- Types: Bash (deterministic) or LLM-based (flexible)
- Purpose: Policy enforcement, context injection, behavior prevention
- Status: FULLY DOCUMENTED

================================================================================
KEY METRICS AND THRESHOLDS DOCUMENTED
================================================================================

Agents per Workflow: 2-6 (recommended based on task scope)
Confidence Threshold: 80 (0-100 scale, filters 70% false positives)
Phases per Workflow: 5-7 phases with clear boundaries
User Gates per Workflow: 2-3 sequential decision points
Model Selection: Sonnet (focused) vs Opus (complex reasoning)
Tool Allowlist: 8-10 tools per agent (explicit declaration)
